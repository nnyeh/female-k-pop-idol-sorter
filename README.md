# Female K-Pop Idol Sorter

A web application designed for ranking female K-pop idols through a series of pairwise comparisons. The app uses a merge-sort based algorithm to generate a personalized, sorted list based on user preferences.

## About the Development Process

I was unsatisfied with how other similar projects looked visually, so I tried my hand at creating a more visually pleasant experience.
The project was "vibe coded", meaning that most of the technical implementation (majority of the codebase, including the React components, sorting logic, and application structure) was generated by Google's Gemini model.
Everything regarding the creative and technical direction, like feature requirements, UI/UX design ideas, and specifications for visual changes was fully me though.

## Features

-   **Efficient Sorting:** Employs a merge-sort algorithm to minimize the number of comparisons needed to create a full ranking.
-   **Pairwise Comparisons:** Users make simple choices between two idols at a time.
-   **Flexible Choices:** Supports selecting a winner or declaring a tie between two idols.
-   **Undo Functionality:** Allows users to undo their previous choice and correct mistakes.
-   **Advanced Filtering:** Users can start a sort by filtering idols by group, debut generation, or by creating a custom selection of individuals.
-   **Session Persistence:** Sorting progress is automatically saved to the browser's local storage, allowing users to pause and resume at any time.
-   **Ranking History:** Finished rankings are saved, allowing users to review and revisit their past results.
-   **Multiple Views:** Final rankings can be viewed as interactive cards or a simple, clean list.
-   **Data Management:** Includes a hidden admin page (`/admin`) for managing the idol and group data used by the application.

## How It Works

The application presents you with two idols at a time. For each pair, you choose which one you prefer, or you can select "Tie" if you rank them equally. Your choices are used to build up a sorted list. This process continues until the algorithm has enough data to generate your complete, personalized ranking of all selected idols.

## Technology Stack

-   **Framework:** React
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom CSS for animations and interactive elements.
-   **Client-Side Storage:** LocalStorage for saving game state and history.
-   **Modules:** Native ES Modules are used, loaded via `esm.sh` for a buildless development environment.

## Local Development

This project is set up to run without a complex build step.

1.  **Prerequisites:** You need a local web server to serve the files. If you use Visual Studio Code, the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension is recommended.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    -   **Using VS Code Live Server:** Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    -   **Using a simple Python server:**
        ```sh
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.

The application should now be running in your browser. All dependencies are fetched dynamically from `esm.sh` as specified in the `index.html` import map.
